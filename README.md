#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a form of engineering that involves the designing, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of a software product using well disciplined scientific principles, methods and procedures. Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it provides reliable and efficient software solutions to problems encounteren in different fields in this digital age.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering the machine era. It is an era whereby software engineering was a concept that was unfamiliar, in this era the main purpose of software was to help the slow computers that had little memory to work as fast and efficiently as possible. 
Mastering the process era. It is the era where the first software crisis occured, programs were complicated and had errors, failures and delays. This led to the concept of software engineering to be born, because a faster, reliable and easier way to build software was needed. Experts created structured methods such as Requirement Engineering Methodology (SREM) and Structured Analysis and design Technique (SADT) to plan and design the software before building.
Mastering the Complexity era. In this era the innovation of personal computers led to a demand for better and user friendly software. Visual programming and graphical user interface gave access to people to be able to use software easily.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning : This phase is where in the team everyone's role is clearly defined and the purpose of the software is defined.
Requirements Analysis : User's needs and expectations are collected in a documentation form then analysed to help the team understand the expectations of the end userd from the software.
Design: Designing the software framework, focusing on the software's functionality, aesthetics and structure.
Implementation : The coding of the software occurs following the designs specifications.
Testing : Testing the software product for any glitches or bugs. Ensuring the software functions flawlessly so.
Deployment: Launching the software to the end users.
Maintenance : Providing assistance to the end users regarding the software product, and upgrading the software product based on the user's evolving requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology follows a linear sequence of events. In the first stage of the waterfall the criteria for completion for each stage in the SDLC is set and each stage must be complete before moving on to the next phase. This methodology doesn't have any room for changes during the other phases of SDLC.
Agile methodology focuses on repetition and flexibility when building a software, it constantly considers user's feedback in improving their software product. It's priorities are collaboration, user feedback and continous improvement.
In the planning phase of SDLC in the agile methodology the developers thoroughly decide on the list of changes to implement on th software product. In the waterfall methodology developers loosely make a list of changes they want to implement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer : Responsible for the coding of the software product. There's different specialisations within the career such as full stack, front end, and back end developer. They primarily use programming languages, software frameworks and libraries to build software products.
Quality Assurance Engineer : They specialize in ensuring that the software works properly and meets its quality standards. They are involved in the testing phase of the SDLC to improve and supervise the testing process.
Project Manager : The person in charge of overseeing the process of the project development and ensures the development of the software is a success. They closely work with developers and stakeholder. They're also in charge of planning and monitoring tasks, facilitating meetings and to accept or reject proposed ideas.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applications that have functions such as software building, editing, testing and packaging all in one easy to use application. It helps developers code software efficiently. IT's important because it has an automatic code editing, when developers are typing it has suggestions ti complete a code statement. It allows a software product to go through an automated local unit test, making it easy to fix any errors or bugs that occur during the testing of the software. Example of an IDE is a Cloud IDE, which allows developers to build and edit code in the browser and it doesn't require one to download any type of software.
VCS keeps track of every change made on a file, allowing one to access different versions of the file and it allows collaboration. VCS is important because it promotes peer review and collaboration leading to better code quality. It enables fast iteration and delivery of features. GIT is an example of VCS, it is an open source software used for different software projects.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers face a challenge of rapid technological advancements, to overcome this challenge software engineers can adopt a continous learning practise to ensure they are always up to date with emerging trends. Another challenge they face is growing customer demands, they can overcome this challenge by always taking customer feedback into consideration when building software so that the software features can be satisfying to the end user.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing : The testing of the smallest testable part of a software product. It can be a method, function, class or a module. Software developers are the ones who write the code for unti tests to ensure their software code is correct and meets the specified requirements. Unit testing is important because it helps with early detection of bugs, it makes the debugging process simple and it improves code quality.
Integration testing : It tests how different components of a software product function as a group, it ensures they work well together as intended. Integration testing is important because it improves software product quality and helps with early detection of possible problems.
Software testing : It tests the entire software product, ensuring it meets its functional and non-functional requirements. In the system testing process testers evaluate how the software product functions in normal and abnormal usage. System testing ensures user satisfaction is increased, reduces risk and it evaluated the reliability, scalability and maintainability of the software product.
Acceptance testing: It is done by stakeholders and end users, it evaluates if the software meets the specified criteria and if it's ready for the deployment phase. This test is important because it helps to reduce possible risks and costs and it ensures the software product meets all the expected requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is detailed and clear questions and statements one asks an AI model in order to get a desired output from the AI model. Prompt engineering is important in AI because it trains the AI models how to give clear outputs with different scenarios of user queries. It makes it easy for end users to get proper results from the AI model on the first try. It allows developers to be in control of how the users prompt the AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt : Create a picture of a tree.
Clear prompt : Create a picture of a cherry tree during the spring season, show green grass on the ground and a river filled with water on the background.
The clear prompt is more effective because it clearly states what type of tree should be created, it also adds specifics by stating that on the ground there should be green grass and on the background a river filled with water. The prompt is clear and concise, it is not vague nor does it contradict itself.
